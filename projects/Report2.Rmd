**This report is due on 2/15/22. Bring a hard copy of the .Rmd code to class as well as the rendered report for the peer code review.** 

- Your rendered report should be no more than 2 pages or so! Use `echo = F` and `results = F` and other code chunk options to curate what is displayed to the reader.
- All elements of the rendered report should be readable and understandable by someone without programming experience.
- Your .Rmd file should contain all code needed to reproduce the report.

## Introduction 
For Report 2, address points raised during the first round of review. Your introduction should include a short paragraph (or two!) that briefly introduces your research question. Include enough background information to convince your reader that your chosen research question is important to address. **Include a citation to at least one relevant peer-reviewed study that has addressed your research question.**  

## Methods  
For Report 2, carry out a regression analysis OR a classification analysis using one of the parametric techniques we have discussed so far. In your Methods section:

1) briefly describe your dataset (number of samples, number of predictors and what they represent, and the response variable) and

2) describe your modeling approach including citations to R and any packages used. 

## Results 
For Report 2, provide at least one but no more than two visual representations of your dataset or analysis. The data should be clearly presented, including labels for *x*- and *y*-axes and any necessary legends.

If you include a table, be sure to format the table appropiately. For example `kable` from the `knitr` package and `kableExtra` provide a lot of great functionality for formatting tables!  

Provide a short interpretation for your analysis (no more than one paragraph).

## Discussion 
For Report 2, provide a short (few sentences) discussion of how your regression or classification analysis relates to your research question.

Provide another few sentences describing whether there were any issues with application of the parametric approaches to your dataset in terms of violating model assumptions or low accuracy. 

## References 
By default these are provided at the end in the rendered document for anything you cited in-line.
